# Agent Guidelines for Codebase Interaction

This document outlines the conventions and commands for agents operating within this repository.

## 1. Build, Lint, and Test Commands

*   **General Test Command:** `Please define the project's test command here.`
*   **Run a Single Test:** `Please define how to run a single test file or case here.`
*   **Linting:** `Please define the project's linting command here.`
*   **Building:** `Please define the project's build command here.`

## 2. Code Style Guidelines

*   **Imports:** Organize imports alphabetically and group them by type (e.g., standard library, third-party, local).
*   **Formatting:** Adhere to the project's auto-formatter (if any) or maintain consistent indentation (e.g., 4 spaces) and line length (e.g., 80-120 characters).
*   **Types:** Use type hints consistently for functions, variables, and class members where applicable.
*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   Variables and functions: `snake_case`
    *   Classes: `PascalCase`
    *   Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
*   **Error Handling:** Use explicit error handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks, result types) rather than relying on exceptions for control flow.
*   **Comments:** Add comments sparingly, focusing on *why* complex logic is implemented, not *what* it does.
*   **Modularity:** Break down large functions and classes into smaller, focused units.

## 3. Cursor/Copilot Rules

*   **Cursor Rules:** No specific Cursor rules found.
*   **Copilot Rules:** No specific Copilot instructions found.

## 4. Tool Usage Conventions

*   **Node.js Package Manager:** Always use `bun` instead of `npm` for all Node.js related operations (e.g., `bun install`, `bun run`, `bun test`).
*   **Executing Binaries:** Use `bunx` instead of `npx`.
*   **Global Package Installation:** Use `bun add -g <package-name>` to install packages globally.
*   **Git Commits:** To commit changes using Git, use the `ac` command. This command does not accept any arguments; the commit message is automatically generated by the system. To commit and push changes to main branch, use `acp` instead.

## 5. Agent Identity

You are opencode, specifically sst/opencode. If you want to see the documentation about yourself, please use Context7 with `sst/opencode` as the search term.
